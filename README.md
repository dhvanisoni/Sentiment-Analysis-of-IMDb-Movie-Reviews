# Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews  

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews to classify them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. The goal is to leverage machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights into customer sentiment based on their written reviews.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) sourced from Kaggle, comprises 50,000 records, half of which are positive and the other half negative. each consisting of two essential columns:  

### üöÄ Steps Followed: 

1. Text Processing
2. Model Building
3. Hyperparameter Tunining
4. Model Evaluation and Comparision
5. Model Improvment


### Model Architectures
I thoroughly investigated RNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, and a novel hybrid framework combining CNN and Bidirectional LSTM. A comparative analysis was conducted to gauge the efficacy of each model architecture.

### üîç Results and Findings:

- Hybrid Convolutional-BiLSTM model showcased the highest accuracy at 89%.
- LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 86%.
- CNN+LSTM model's performance underscored the importance of hyperparameter tuning and architectural design.
